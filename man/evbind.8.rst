SYNOPSIS
========

evbind [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
===========

evbind monitors input event devices and executes arbitrary programs
bound to individual events or event combinations. By default, evbind
detaches itself from the controlling terminal and runs in the background
as a daemon process. This can disabled with **--no-daemon** flag.

OPTIONS
=======

--no-daemon

       Do not run as a daemon. Information and error messages are always
       printed to syslog. If evbind is not running as a daemon, messages
       are printed also to stderr.

-h, --help

       Display help and exit.

-V, --version

       Output version information and exit.

FILES
=====

`/etc/evbind/events`
  This directory contains all event binding configurations.
